First ever developing a video game.
Made this little game in 1 month.
I've never coded anything before January 2024, I had no skills or knowledges in coding.
I've worked alone on this project, I'm aware of some issues on which I'm still working on.
Also my code looks a bit messy and spaghetiffied, I am aware of that lack of organization. Since it is my first big project it's normal to start from scratches, I'll clean the code later.
